# Zerodha Clone

This is a clone of the Zerodha website, created using HTML and CSS. The project is aimed at replicating the layout and design of the Zerodha platform, 
and I am currently working on making it fully responsive using media queries.

## Project Structure

- `assets/` - Contains all the images, icons, and other media assets used in the project.
- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the website.
- `style.css` - The stylesheet for styling the website.

## Features

- Basic structure and layout of the Zerodha website
- Responsive design (in progress)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vaitae/zerodha-clone.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd zerodha-clone
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project.

## Future Work

- Implement media queries for full responsiveness
- Enhance the UI with interactive elements
- Add additional pages and features similar to Zerodha
