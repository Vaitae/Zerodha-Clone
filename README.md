# Zerodha Clone (Frontend)

This is a clone of the Zerodha website, created using HTML and CSS. The project is aimed at replicating the layout and design of the Zerodha platform, 
and I am currently working on making it fully responsive.

## Project Structure

- `assets/` - Contains all the images, icons, and other media assets used in the project.
- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the website.
- `style.css` - The stylesheet for styling the website.

## Features

- Basic structure and layout of the Zerodha website
- Responsive design (in progress)


## Future Work

- Implement media queries for full responsiveness
- Enhance the UI with interactive elements
- Add additional pages and features similar to Zerodha
